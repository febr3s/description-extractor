And as archaeologists accustomed to dealing with ""deep time,"" how can we best understand the possibilities and limitations of the Web in meeting the specialized needs of professionals in this field? These are among the many questions posed and addressed in Archaeology 2.0: New Approaches to Communication and Collaboration, edited by Eric Kansa, Sarah Whitcher Kansa, and Ethan Watrall. With contributions from a range of experts in archaeology and technology, this volume is organized around four key topics that illuminate how the revolution in communications technology reverberates across the discipline: approaches to information retrieval and information access; practical and theoretical concerns inherent in design choices for archaeology's computing infrastructure; collaboration through the development of new technologies that connect field-based researchers and specialists within an international archaeological community and scholarly communications issues, with an emphasis on concerns over sustainability and preservation imperatives. This book not only describes practices that attempt to mitigate some of the problems associated with the Web, such as information overload and disinformation, it also presents compelling case studies of actual digital projects--many of which are rich in structured data and multimedia content or focused on generating content from the field ""in real time,"" and all of which demonstrate how the Web can and is being used to transform archaeological communications into forms that are more open, inclusive, and participatory. Above all, this volume aims to share these experiences to provide useful guidance for other researchers interested in applying technology to archaeology.

Postmodernity is lived, it seems, at the end of history. In the essays collected in Local Transcendence, Alan Liu takes the pulse of such postmodern historicism by tracking two leading indicators of its acceleration in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries: postmodern cultural criticism—including the new historicism, the new cultural history, cultural anthropology, the new pragmatism, and postmodern and postindustrial theory—and digital information technology. What is the relation between the new historicist anecdote and the database field, Liu asks, and can either have a critical function in the age of postmodern historicism? Local Transcendence includes two previously unpublished essays and a synthetic introduction in which Liu traverses from his earlier work on the theory of historicism to his recent studies of information culture to propose a theory of contingent method incorporating a special inflection of history: media history.

Yet the use of these tools is limited—many historians and history educators have resisted adopting them because they fail to see how digital tools supplement and even improve upon conventional tools (such as books). In Pastplay, a collection of essays by leading history and humanities researchers and teachers, editor Kevin Kee works to address these concerns head-on. How should we use technology? Playfully, Kee contends. Why? Because doing so helps us think about the past in new ways; through the act of creating technologies, our understanding of the past is re-imagined and developed. From the insights of numerous scholars and teachers, Pastplay argues that we should play with technology in history because doing so enables us to see the past in new ways by helping us understand how history is created; honoring the roots of research, teaching, and technology development; requiring us to model our thoughts; and then allowing us to build our own understanding.",2014,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,,Digital Culture,,,,Univ. of Michigan Press,Ann Arbor,en,,,,,,,,"A collection of scholars and teachers of history unpack how computing technologies are transforming the ways that we learn, communicate, and teach.

Lawrence Lessig could be called a cultural environmentalist. One of America's most original and influential public intellectuals, his focus is the social dimension of creativity: how creative work builds on the past and how society encourages or inhibits that building with laws and technologies. In his two previous books, Code and The Future of Ideas, Lessig concentrated on the destruction of much of the original promise of the Internet. Now, in Free Culture, he widens his focus to consider the diminishment of the larger public domain of ideas. In this powerful wake-up call he shows how short-sighted interests blind to the long-term damage they're inflicting are poisoning the ecosystem that fosters innovation. All creative works-books, movies, records, software, and so on-are a compromise between what can be imagined and what is possible-technologically and legally. For more than two hundred years, laws in America have sought a balance between rewarding creativity and allowing the borrowing from which new creativity springs. The original term of copyright set by the Constitution in 1787 was seventeen years. Now it is closer to two hundred. Thomas Jefferson considered protecting the public against overly long monopolies on creative works an essential government role. What did he know that we've forgotten? Lawrence Lessig shows us that while new technologies always lead to new laws, never before have the big cultural monopolists used the fear created by new technologies, specifically the Internet, to shrink the public domain of ideas, even as the same corporations use the same technologies to control more and more what we can and can't do with culture. As more and more culture becomes digitized, more and more becomes controllable, even as laws are being toughened at the behest of the big media groups. What's at stake is our freedom-freedom to create, freedom to build, and ultimately, freedom to imagine.

Nos guste o no, tenemos que asumir que nuestros hábitos de creación, acceso y consumo cultural están experimentando una transformación histórica con la llegada de Internet. Ante estas nuevas formas de crear, acceder y consumir la cultura, autores, editores, libreros y bibliotecarios, entre otros, deberán reflexionar sobre cuál será su nuevo papel.

You'll learn how to look at data to discover what it contains, how to capture those ideas in conceptual models, and then feed your understanding back into the organization through business plans, metrics dashboards, and other applications. Along the way, you'll experiment with concepts through hands-on workshops at the end of each chapter. Above all, you'll learn how to think about the results you want to achieve -- rather than rely on tools to think for you.

And as archaeologists accustomed to dealing with ""deep time,"" how can we best understand the possibilities and limitations of the Web in meeting the specialized needs of professionals in this field? These are among the many questions posed and addressed in Archaeology 2.0: New Approaches to Communication and Collaboration, edited by Eric Kansa, Sarah Whitcher Kansa, and Ethan Watrall. With contributions from a range of experts in archaeology and technology, this volume is organized around four key topics that illuminate how the revolution in communications technology reverberates across the discipline: approaches to information retrieval and information access; practical and theoretical concerns inherent in design choices for archaeology's computing infrastructure; collaboration through the development of new technologies that connect field-based researchers and specialists within an international archaeological community and scholarly communications issues, with an emphasis on concerns over sustainability and preservation imperatives. This book not only describes practices that attempt to mitigate some of the problems associated with the Web, such as information overload and disinformation, it also presents compelling case studies of actual digital projects--many of which are rich in structured data and multimedia content or focused on generating content from the field ""in real time,"" and all of which demonstrate how the Web can and is being used to transform archaeological communications into forms that are more open, inclusive, and participatory. Above all, this volume aims to share these experiences to provide useful guidance for other researchers interested in applying technology to archaeology.

Which paint color is most likely to tell you that a used car is in good shape? How can officials identify the most dangerous New York City manholes before they explode? And how did Google searches predict the spread of the H1N1 flu outbreak? The key to answering these questions, and many more, is big data. “Big data” refers to our burgeoning ability to crunch vast collections of information, analyze it instantly, and draw sometimes profoundly surprising conclusions from it. This emerging science can translate myriad phenomena—from the price of airline tickets to the text of millions of books—into searchable form, and uses our increasing computing power to unearth epiphanies that we never could have seen before. A revolution on par with the Internet or perhaps even the printing press, big data will change the way we think about business, health, politics, education, and innovation in the years to come. It also poses fresh threats, from the inevitable end of privacy as we know it to the prospect of being penalized for things we haven’t even done yet, based on big data’s ability to predict our future behavior. In this brilliantly clear, often surprising work, two leading experts explain what big data is, how it will change our lives, and what we can do to protect ourselves from its hazards.

His elegant readings reveal that the most striking similarities between these two lie not in their nationality or style but in their shared fascination with the process of revision. Van Hulle's thoughtful application of genetic theory--the study of a work from manuscript to final form in its various iterations--marks a new phase in this dynamic field of inquiry. As one of only a handful of books in English dealing with this emerging area of study, Manuscript Genetics, Joyce's Know-How, Beckett's Nohow will be indispensable not only to Joyce and Beckett scholars but also to anyone interested in genetic criticism.

The project consists of two parts: a digital archive of Beckett's a manuscripts, with facsimiles and transcriptions, organized in modules; b a series of print volumes, analyzing the genesis of Beckett's works. This first volume of the BDMP studies Beckett's last works: ""Stirrings still / Soubresauts and Comment dire/what is the word"". It examines the notes, manuscripts, typescripts and other writing traces and reconstructs the dynamics of the composition process on the basis of this material.

Most records today are born digital, and libraries and other collecting institutions increasingly receive computer storage media as part of their acquisition of ""papers"" from writers, scholars, scientists, musicians, and public figures. This poses new challenges to librarians, archivists, and curators—challenges related to accessing and preserving legacy formats, recovering data, ensuring authenticity, and maintaining trust. The methods and tools developed by forensics experts represent a novel approach to these demands. For example, the same forensics software that indexes a criminal suspect's hard drive allows the archivist to prepare a comprehensive manifest of the electronic files a donor has turned over for accession. This report introduces the field of digital forensics in the cultural heritage sector and explores some points of convergence between the interests of those charged with collecting and maintaining born-digital cultural heritage materials and those charged with collecting and maintaining legal evidence.",2010,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,Council on Library and Information Resources,Washington  D.C.,en,,,,,,,,"<div class=""comment"">

We recognize differences between a politician who is ""willful"" and one who is ""willing"" even though the difference does not cross word-stems or parts of speech. We recognize that being ""held up"" evokes different experiences depending upon whether its direct object is a meeting, a bank, or an example. Although we can notice hundreds of examples in the language where small differences in wording produce large reader effects, the authors of The Power of Words argue that these examples are random glimpses of a hidden systematic knowledge that governs how we, as writers or speakers, learn to shape experience for other human beings. Over the past several years, David Kaufer and his colleagues have developed a software program for analyzing writing called DocuScope. This book illustrates the concepts and rhetorical theory behind the software analysis, examining patterns in writing and showing writers how their writing works in different categories to accomplish varying objectives. Reflecting the range and variety of audience experience that contiguous words of surface English can prime, the authors present a theory of language as an instrument of rhetorically priming audiences and a catalog of English strings to implement the theory. The project creates a comprehensive map of the speaker and writer's implicit knowledge about predisposing audience experience at the point of utterance. The book begins with an explanation of why studying language from the standpoint of priming--not just meaning--is vital to non-question begging theories of close reading and to language education in general. The remaining chapters in Part I detail the steps taken to prepare a catalog study of English strings for their properties as priming instruments. Part II describes in detail the catalog of priming categories, including enough examples to help readers see how individual words and strings of English fit into the catalog. The final part describes how the authors have applied the catalog of English strings as priming tools to conduct textual research.",2004,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,New Jersey & London,en,,,,,,,,"Over the past several years, David Kaufer and his colleagues have developed a software program for analyzing writing (DocuScope).

According to Lanham, the central commodity in our new age of information is not stuff but style, for style is what competes for our attention amidst the din and deluge of new media. In such a world, intellectual property will become more central to the economy than real property, while the arts and letters will grow to be more crucial than engineering, the physical sciences, and indeed economics as conventionally practiced. For Lanham, the arts and letters are the disciplines that study how human attention is allocated and how cultural capital is created and traded. In an economy of attention, style and substance change places. The new attention economy, therefore, will anoint a new set of moguls in the business world—not the CEOs or fund managers of yesteryear, but new masters of attention with a grounding in the humanities and liberal arts.

CGWEYU4S,book,2013,"Manovich, Lev",Software takes command,,978-1-62356-745-3 978-1-62356-817-7,,,http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/software-takes-command,"Software has replaced a diverse array of physical, mechanical, and electronic technologies used before 21st century to create, store, distribute and interact with cultural artifacts. It has become our interface to the world, to others, to our memory and our imagination - a universal language through which the world speaks, and a universal engine on which the world runs. What electricity and combustion engine were to the early 20th century, software is to the early 21st century. Offering the the first theoretical and historical account of software for media authoring and its effects on the practice and the very concept of 'media,' the author of The Language of New Media (2001) develops his own theory for this rapidly-growing, always-changing field. What was the thinking and motivations of people who in the 1960 and 1970s created concepts and practical techniques that underlie contemporary media software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Maya, Final Cut and After Effects? How do their interfaces and tools shape the visual aesthetics of contemporary media and design? What happens to the idea of a 'medium' after previously media-specific tools have been simulated and extended in software? Is it still meaningful to talk about different mediums at all? Lev Manovich answers these questions and supports his theoretical arguments by detailed analysis of key media applications such as Photoshop and After Effects, popular web services such as Google Earth, and the projects in motion graphics, interactive environments, graphic design and architecture. Software Takes Command is a must for all practicing designers and media artists and scholars concerned with contemporary media.",2013,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bloomsbury,New York,en,,,,,,,,"This book is available as open access through the Bloomsbury Open Access programme and is available on www.bloomsburycollections.com.

Lang,Frankfurt am Main ; New York,en,,,,,,,,"Umfangreiche statistische Daten, die mit einem Computerprogramm ermittelt wurden, erlauben erstmals eine vollständige quantitative Untersuchung des dramatischen Werkes Shakespeares unter dem Gesichtspunkt seiner strukturellen, ästhetischen und typologischen Erscheinungsformen. Zu den auffälligen Ergebnissen gehört die am häufigsten verwendete Länge von Repliken. Dramen, die vor 1599 entstanden, weisen einen Scheitelpunkt zwischen 8 und 10 Worten auf. Mit Eröffnung des Globe Theatre im Jahre 1599 sinkt die am häufigsten vorkommende Replikenlänge auf 4 oder 5 Worte. Typologische Eigenschaften der Dramen werden auf der Basis von 28 entwickelten Kriterien unterschieden und ebenso wie Untersuchungen zu Konfigurationen und Repliken vollständig in Graphiken dokumentarisch erfaßt.

En effet, chercheurs et praticiens ont aujourd'hui à faire face à un double développement, d'une part celui des textes provenant des enquêtes, des entretiens, des archives, des bases documentaires, d'autre part, celui des outils informatiques de saisie et de gestion des textes. La statistique textuelle se veut précisément un outil destiné à parfaire l'analyse, la description, la comparaison, en un mot, le traitement des textes. Ce livre, illustré d'exemples nombreux, présente les concepts de base et les fondements des méthodes de la statistique textuelle. Il combine une approche pédagogique des outils et un exposé sur l'état de l'art de cette discipline.",1994,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dunod,Paris,fr,,,,,,,,"<div class=""comment"">
