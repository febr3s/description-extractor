DXNV5YUP,book,2010,"Alpaydin, Ethem",Introduction to machine learning,,978-0-262-01243-0,,,http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-machine-learning,"The goal of machine learning is to program computers to use example data or past experience to solve a given problem. Many successful applications of machine learning exist already, including systems that analyze past sales data to predict customer behavior, optimize robot behavior so that a task can be completed using minimum resources, and extract knowledge from bioinformatics data. Introduction to Machine Learning is a comprehensive textbook on the subject, covering a broad array of topics not usually included in introductory machine learning texts. In order to present a unified treatment of machine learning problems and solutions, it discusses many methods from different fields, including statistics, pattern recognition, neural networks, artificial intelligence, signal processing, control, and data mining. All learning algorithms are explained so that the student can easily move from the equations in the book to a computer program. The text covers such topics as supervised learning, Bayesian decision theory, parametric methods, multivariate methods, multilayer perceptrons, local models, hidden Markov models, assessing and comparing classification algorithms, and reinforcement learning. New to the second edition are chapters on kernel machines, graphical models, and Bayesian estimation; expanded coverage of statistical tests in a chapter on design and analysis of machine learning experiments; case studies available on the Web (with downloadable results for instructors); and many additional exercises. All chapters have been revised and updated. Introduction to Machine Learning can be used by advanced undergraduates and graduate students who have completed courses in computer programming, probability, calculus, and linear algebra. It will also be of interest to engineers in the field who are concerned with the application of machine learning methods.",2010,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,537,,,,,,Adaptive computation and machine learning,,,,MIT Press,"Cambridge, Mass",en,,,,,,,,"Just like electricity, Machine Learning will revolutionize our life in many ways – some of which are not even conceivable today. This book provides a thorough conceptual understanding of Machine Learning techniques and algorithms. Many of the mathematical concepts are explained in an intuitive manner. The book starts with an overview of machine learning and the underlying Mathematical and Statistical concepts before moving onto machine learning topics. It gradually builds up the depth, covering many of the present day machine learning algorithms, ending in Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning algorithms. The book also covers some of the popular Machine Learning applications. The material in this book is agnostic to any specific programming language or hardware so that readers can try these concepts on whichever platforms they are already familiar with. Offers a comprehensive introduction to Machine Learning, while not assuming any priorknowledge of the topic; Provides a complete overview of available techniques and algorithms in conceptual terms, covering various application domains of machine learning; Not tied to any specific software language or hardware implementation.",,,,AnalyzeStatistically; obj_AnyObject; *****,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2nd ed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This year, the world will generate 5 zettabytes of data. (That's a five with twenty-one zeros after it.) Big data is revolutionizing the sciences, transforming the humanities, and renegotiating the boundary between industry and the ivory tower. What is emerging is a new way of understanding our world, our past, and possibly, our future. In Uncharted, Erez Aiden and Jean-Baptiste Michel tell the story of how they tapped into this sea of information to create a new kind of telescope: a tool that, instead of uncovering the motions of distant stars, charts trends in human history across the centuries. By teaming up with Google, they were able to analyze the text of millions of books. The result was a new field of research and a scientific tool, the Google Ngram Viewer, so groundbreaking that its public release made the front page of The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Boston Globe, and so addictive that Mother Jones called it ""the greatest timewaster in the history of the internet."" Using this scope, Aiden and Michel-and millions of users worldwide-are beginning to see answers to a dizzying array of once intractable questions. How quickly does technology spread? Do we talk less about God today? When did people start ""having sex"" instead of ""making love""? At what age do the most famous people become famous? How fast does grammar change? Which writers had their works most effectively censored by the Nazis? When did the spelling ""donut"" start replacing the venerable ""doughnut""? Can we predict the future of human history? Who is better known-Bill Clinton or the rutabaga? All over the world, new scopes are popping up, using big data to quantify the human experience at the grandest scales possible.

Written specifically for students studying this topic for the first time, the book begins with a discussion of the underlying principles of electronic text analysis. It then examines how these corpora enhance our understanding of literary and non-literary works. In the first section the author introduces the concepts of concordance and lexical frequency, concepts which are then applied to a range of areas of language study. Key areas examined are the use of on-line corpora to complement traditional stylistic analysis, and the ways in which methods such as concordance and frequency counts can reveal a particular ideology within a text. Presenting an accessible and thorough understanding of the underlying principles of electronic text analysis, the book contains abundant illustrative examples and a glossary with definitions of main concepts.
